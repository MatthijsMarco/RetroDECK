There is the possibility to provide custom emutlators provided by the user.

At the moment the only one available is Yuzu.
Place your custom Yuzu files (AppImage and such) in the custom/yuzu folder without any other subfolders, like in the example:
retrodeck/customs/yuzu/yuzu*.AppImage

WARNINGS on custom emulators:
- Custom emulators are self managed: means that RetroDECK Team is not supporting nor troubleshooting them.
- Custom emulators could potentially break other included emulators configs: use them at your own risk.
- Remember to make the binary executable, otherwise they won't be launched.
- Hotkeys might not be working if not configured by the users.
